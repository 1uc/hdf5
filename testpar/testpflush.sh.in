# Test script for the parallel flush test
#
# The parallel flush test uses two programs to test flush operations
# in parallel HDF5. The first program purposely exits without calling
# MPI_Finalize(), which is an error under the MPI standard and mpiexec
# in some implementations will return an error code even though all
# processes exit successfully. This script lets us swallow the error
# from the first program.
#
# True errors in the first program will be detected as errors in the
# second program, so watch out for that.
