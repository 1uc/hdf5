evict_on_close

This branch is for the development of the "evict on close" feature
which will cause the library to evict all cached information
on object close.

Dana Robinson is in charge of the branch, which follows the trunk.
It will be deleted when the feature is merged to the trunk.

Key changes:

* New H5Pset/get_evict_on_close() functions that enable and disable
  the feature (default: disabled).

* New property: H5F_ACS_EVICT_ON_CLOSE_FLAG

* Added match_global flag to H5AC_evict_tagged_metadata() and
  H5C_evict_tagged_entries() parameter lists.

* H5D_close() updated to evict on close, when the property is set.

* New evict_on_close test to exercise the function.
